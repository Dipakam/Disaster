# Disaster-Artists
Microsoft Code Fun Do ++

We plan to make a web app which will be helpful in finding the people who are in danger at the times of natural disaster. So the locations of the people will be stored, and it will be passed to the teams trying to help them. The team will get a map on which they will have the data about the location of each of the person who is in danger.
The app will also provide the people who are in danger with the ways to contact the teams that are on the way to help them. In the case of earthquakes, the app will provide then the information about the nearest safe place and a few To-Dos to save themselves.
